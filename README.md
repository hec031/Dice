Dice throwing

I was wondering how hard it would be to make game based on dice throws, so I created this to deal with the main mechanics of a game like this.
There is a lot of possibilities from these simple mechanics.
This project used free Unity Asset Store assets. So, it's all free.
Any can use this as a starting point for their game. Good luck.
If you need any help contact me.
